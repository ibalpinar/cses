Solutions of the algorithms available on https://cses.fi/ in various languages from my perspective...

The languages that Iâ€™m thinking of using are mostly C/C++, Javascript, Java, or Python. Sometimes I may use more than one language to solve some problems that I think will make a difference.

If you would like to contribute alternative solutions to the problems, just send a PR to the 'dev' branch. After an interactive discussion, I'll accept your solutions into the repository.

If you want to have fun, let's solve some algorithmic problems together.
